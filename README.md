<h2>Digital Hiring Website</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Digital Hiring Platform! This platform is designed to streamline the recruitment process by enabling
    recruiters to provide job descriptions and applicants to submit their resumes, LeetCode profiles, GitHub profiles,
    and 1-minute video introductions. Behind the scenes, machine learning algorithms are used to match applicants to job
    descriptions, including evaluating eye contact in the video submissions. The results are presented in a graphical
    dashboard for easy assessment.<br>

This system facilitates the assessment of candidates' qualifications, skills, education, and work experience as they discuss their background in video introductions. It employs a scoring mechanism that considers essential qualifications specified in the job description, as well as soft skills demonstrated in the video.
